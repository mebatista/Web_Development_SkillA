            <h2>Our Library</h2>
            <p>Fremantle City Library, a small local establishment, has been in operation for over three years. Over time, the library has expanded significantly to cater to the growing demands of our readers, with numerous books being added to our collection. However, due to limited manpower in the library to assist readers in learning about these books, we have decided to create a book review website.</p>

            <h2> Fremantle Life </h2>
            <p> Fremantle, a vibrant port city nestled along the western coast of Australia, pulses with a unique energy that intertwines history, culture, and modernity. Life in Fremantle unfolds amidst a picturesque backdrop of colonial-era architecture, bustling markets, and the rhythmic lapping of waves against its shores. Steeped in maritime heritage, the city's docks hum with activity as ships from around the globe dock, bearing cargo and stories from distant lands.</p>
